The solution involves using a more specific selector to target the inner `<span>` element on hover, ensuring its style has higher specificity than the parent's `:hover` style.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

div span {
  display: block;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

div:hover span {
  background-color: orange; /* Now works as expected */
}
```

By targeting `div:hover span`, we've increased the specificity of the selector, ensuring the desired hover effect is applied correctly.
