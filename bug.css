The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class on a nested element doesn't work as anticipated due to specificity issues and event bubbling.  The hover effect on the inner `<span>` doesn't trigger because the outer `<div>`'s style rule is more specific.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

div span {
  display: block;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

div span:hover {
  background-color: orange; /* This doesn't work as expected */
}
```
